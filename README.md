# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Element Visibility

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to hiding HTML elements using CSS properties `display` and `visibility`.

The bug occurs due to redundant usage of both `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` in an attempt to hide an element. While functionally similar in this case, this combination might lead to unpredictable behavior, particularly across different browsers and in complex layouts. 

The `bug.html` file showcases the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Details
The initial attempt hides the element using both `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`.  While in this specific instance, the outcome is the same, it represents a redundant and less efficient approach.  It can lead to problems with CSS specificity and unexpected rendering behaviors.

## Solution
The solution involves using only one of the CSS properties to control the visibility of the element.  Using `display: none` is generally preferred as it removes the element entirely from the document flow.
